It can't match subdirectories unless you manually write a recursive function.\n\nOn the other hand, `fnmatch` is used along with `os.walk()`, as demonstrated in the script. This combination allows you to recursively visit all subdirectories and files, making it more convenient to match files in a directory tree.\n\nOne of the advantages of using `glob` is that it can sort the results, while `fnmatch` cannot. However, `glob` does not support efficient recursive file searching, which is a point for `fnmatch`.\n\nChoosing between the two depends on the exact use case and requirements."
