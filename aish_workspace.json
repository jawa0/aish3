For each of your text textures, you will need \nto create a surface it can be copied into. Use \n\"SDL_TextureToSurface\" to copy the texture to a \nsurface with matching dimensions.\n\n3. Once you have a surface copy of the texture, \nyou can use \"SDL_BlitSurface\" to then copy these \nsurface(s) onto the initial surface you created. \n\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each of your textures, \npositioning them carefully on the target surface.\n\n5. Finally, once you have copied all your \ndesired textures as surfaces onto your target \nsurface, you'll need to create a texture from this \nsurface. Use \"SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface\" to do \nthis.\n\n6. The texture can then be copied to your \nrenderer using \"SDL_RenderCopy\".\n\nIt should be noted that PySDL might not expose all \nthese SDL features. If that is the case, you might \nneed to consider using the SDL library directly or \nrefactor your design to be compatible with the \nPySDL capabilities. \n\nRemember that the surfaces and textures should be \nproperly destroyed after use to avoid memory leaks, \nespecially in a loop. Make sure to use \n\"SDL_FreeSurface\" for the surfaces and \n\"SDL_DestroyTexture\" for the textures when they are \nno longer needed."
